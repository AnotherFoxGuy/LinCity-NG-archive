/**
 * @author Matthias Braun.
 * @file Component.hpp
 * @class Component
 * @brief Implementation of blocks which are a rectangular area on screen.
 *
 * The Component is the basic building block of the GUI. It represents a
 * rectangular area on screen which receives events and is able to draw itself.
 * This class has to be used as a base class to implement specific
 * gui-components like buttons or windows.
 *
 * Currently there are 2 sorts of components: resizable ones and fixed-size
 * ones. A fixed size component should have it's size set after creation (you
 * should set the width and height fields in the constructor).
 * Resizable components should set the resize flag in the constructor and
 * override the resize function. If the resize function is called the component
 * should decide on the size it needs (it might only need a fraction of the size
 * passed in in the resize call), and then set the width and height members
 * accordingly.
 *
 * Components are typically put in a tree (for example you can put
 * child-components in a TableLayout or in a Window). However components
 * typically don't have to take care of this. The corrdinates in the mouse
 * events are transformed into corrdinates relative to the component origin.
 * Also the painter passed to the draw function will have a transformation
 * set, so that you can simply use coordinates ralative to the component origin.
