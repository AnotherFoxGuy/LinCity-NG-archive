	<p style="htitle">Residential area</p>
        <p style="hp">This is where people live. To encourage people to live in this area they must be fed (be within the range of a water well and get food from markets or transports). It also helps to provide them with work and goods to buy. They must be within range of a market or connected to transport (like most buildings).</p>
        <p style="hp">There are 3 different types of residential areas: Low, Medium and High density housing. These have different birth and death rates associated with them. This gives you some control over your population.</p>
	<p style="hp">Later in the game, if you have sufficient technology, you can build more 'modern' housing, even tower blocks.</p>
