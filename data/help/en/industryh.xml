	<p style="hp">Steel works produce steel from ore, power and jobs. Ore is obtained directly from the connected transport.The steel is placed onto the transport as well. Jobs are obtained from a local market. Transport connects to the top left corner.</p>
	<p style="hp">Power can be provided to the steel works in two ways. The first is from coal, which is obtained directly from connected transport. The second is from electricity: you must have one or more active substations within range of the steel works. (Windmills do <b>not</b> supply power to steel works.)</p>
	<p style="hp">Steel works produce pollution</p>
	<p style="hp">You can see when Heavy Industry is working in the usual way, by clicking on it, and every so often the animation will come to life.</p>
