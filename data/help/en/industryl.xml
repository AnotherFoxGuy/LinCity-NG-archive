	<p style="htitle">Light industrial areas</p>
	<p style="hp">Light industry converts ore into goods. The conversion becomes more efficient if steel is also available. Power increases the output further still. Windmills do <b>not</b> provide power for these areas.</p>
	<p style="hp">As a rule of thumb, ignoring the above, the output of a light industrial area is mainly dependent on the amount of raw materials, including jobs, that it can receive, and also the amount of goods that can be <b>taken away</b>.</p>
	<p style="hp">These areas connect directly to transport to exchange ore, steel and goods. They may need a market to supply jobs.</p>
	<p style="hp">These areas connect to transport <b>only</b> to the top left hand corner, as shown. Transport will curve in when it is connected.</p>
