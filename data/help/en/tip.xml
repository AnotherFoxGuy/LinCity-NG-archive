	<p style="hp">Tips provide a place to put your rubbish. If you accumulate too much at markets, they are forced to burn some. This makes quite a lot of pollution so you should be wary of letting rubbish accumulate.</p>
	<p style="hp">As the tip is filled, it slowly turns into a hill, which is grassed over when it is full.</p>
	<p style="hp">Transport connects to the top left hand corner of the tip as usual.</p>
	<p style="hp">You can see when a tip is working in the usual way, by clicking on it, and every so often the animation will come to life.</p>
