	<p style="hp">Coal fired power stations produce packets of electricity which are placed onto connected power lines.</p>
	<p style="hp">Power lines connect at the top left corner of the station, transport connects to the next position in. See the example.</p>

    <p style="hp">The above example shows a coal fired power
      station with all its connection points used. To the left there
      is a road, above this there are two power lines. To their
      right a railway is connected to the other transport connection
      point. To toggle visibility of high buildings press <b>h </b>.</p>

	<p style="hp">The efficiency of the conversion of coal to electricity increases with each tech level - when the station is <b>built</b>. You may want to demolish an old station and replace it with a newer, more efficient one, when your tech level has increased by a significant amount.</p>
