	<p style="htitle">Transport</p>
	<p style="hp">There are three types of transport in Lincity: tracks, roads and railways.</p>
	<p style="hp">There is a fourth form that consists of 'hopping across a field' to reach a market. This is a very short range form of trading and will not be referred to as transport again. However, it is very important, so you should read again <a href="market"> markets</a>.</p>

	<p style="hp">Tracks, roads and railways are used to carry food, jobs, goods, coal, ore, steel and wastes between areas. Transport between markets, transport for buildings out of range of a market (this is generally a bad idea) and transport for building that explicitely need it:</p>
	<li>Communes just need to be adjacent to transport</li>
	<li>Light industries, ore mines, tips, ports, coal mines, heavy industries and recycling centers <b>need to</b> connect to transport at the top left hand corner. You will see the transport "bend", thus show the connection.</li>
	<li>An exception is the coal power station: the top left corner is used for connection to the electric line, so the transport connect just near.</li>
	<p style="hp">For example, an heavy industry can connect by road to a coal mine, and by rail to other resources like ore mine and markets.</p>

	<p style="hp">To cross a river with transport, simply build the transport over the river and you will create a bridge. Bridges are much more expensive than normal transport.</p>

	<p style="hp">Roads and Rail causes yearly costs (for maintenance) and pollution (and more pollution if they carry lots of wastes).</p>
