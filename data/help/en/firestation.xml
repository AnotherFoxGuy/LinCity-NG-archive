	<p style="htitle">Fire stations</p>
	<p style="hp">Fire stations prevent the start and spread of fire within the range that they cover. They need to be supplied with goods and jobs to work. They do <b>not</b> have to be connected to transport, they do though have to be within range of a market that can supply the jobs and goods. They also cost money to run.</p>
	<p style="hp">When you build a fire station, it does not start straight away. There is usually a three month wait before fire cover is provided.</p>
	<p style="hp">To see the area that your fire stations cover, click on the fire station button under the <i>mini screen</i>. Areas that have fire cover are displayed as normal, areas not covered are just dark green.</p>
	<p style="hp">Fire stations increase the desirability of residential areas within their range.</p>
	<p style="hp">Fire stations go through an animation sequence every three month to show that they are working.</p>
