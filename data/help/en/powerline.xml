	<p style="hp">Power lines carry power from solar and coal power stations and modern windmills to substations. Power lines connect to the top left corner of each of the four types of icons, solar and coal power stations, modern windmills and substations.</p>
	<p style="hp">Power lines cross <b>under</b> tracks, roads, railways and rivers (all of the width of 1). If a power line is placed either side of a transport or river area, they act as if they are joined. Often you will have to bulldoze a bit of river to cross a river - it's expensive! The power lines are joined when they are in a straight line.</p>
