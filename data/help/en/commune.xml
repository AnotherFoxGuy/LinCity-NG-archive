	<p style="hp">Communes (for want of a better name) are areas where charcoal burners coppice woods to make charcoal (the same as coal here). They also produce small amounts of ore and steel.</p>
	<p style="hp">You will probably need a 'few' communes to provide enough coal and steel for areas such as potteries, blacksmiths and mills.</p>
	<p style="hp">If a commune is not producing anything for 10 years it is closed and the area turns in parks.</p>
	<p style="hp">Communes can connect to transport at any point around it, not only to the gate.</p>
	<p style="hp">Communes' coal production depends on underground water. (tiles with water are green, others are yellow-brown like desert)</p>
