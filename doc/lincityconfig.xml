<!-- Game Section -->
 <game quickness="9" />
<!-- quickness is saved to userconfig.xml
    Commandline -q [delay] sets the delay for fast mode, default is 9.
    9 is default. This skips animation frames, good on slow machines.
    8 to 1 have nice animations in fast mode.
    1 is fastest. It may heat your hardware!
-->
<!-- The values monthgraphW and monthgraphH influence the Size
    of the Economy-Graphs. If you are not a developer just stick to 
    the defaults.
    skipMonthsFast determines how many Months are skipped in
    fastest mode until the MainScreen is updated again. The
    default of 1 seems to be a good choice.
